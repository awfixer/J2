Some Day, some time, somewhere

#### ENTRY ONE

So today was a normal day, I work up from a dream that was hypr-realistic, I got yelled at by some fucking driver who thought he had the right of way, I went to work, I felt empty.

This is every weekday for me before Noon, but when Noon comes around, things become different..

I turn on my computer, and I log on to the internet.

What did I do on the web today, blocked and cleared spammers from my DMs, fielded a message from someone I hate, took a business call, and I updated my systems

Now, what a lot of people fail to realize about me is that I got by many, many names, in fact I hear of people who have heard of me, who I have never talked too.

I am a man of hellish values, I don't care for people and I dont feel bad for what I do, emotions are not an issue for me, I simply am not afflicted with them

I got an update that the Anons were "at it again"

but then things got weird, lolzsec was making a racket again

So, I logged back into an account I usually refuse to touch, and they were right, old members of lolzsec wanted something

This is my side hussle, I am a hacker, but being a specialist in psycology, I spend the majority of my time dealing with the disputes of other, lesser known, and lesser skilled hackers

Turns out what they wanted was to be recognized as better then ALPHV, and my response was simple, you are all idiots.

#### ENTRY TWO

The Next Day, some time, somewhere else... 

I woke up today from a dream about my bsf who got shot yesterday, he didn't deserve it, but sadly it happens.

The point of what I do is. To prevent his situation from happening, as it was pure racism.

Today I figured I would document that unless I'm intentionally vanishing, i am a naturally slippery operator, my day to day lifestyle is hard as fuck to keep track of. 

Had to help someone today, this put me in a sour mood as I hate people...

Learned that the syntax for Rust did not work in non-latin symbols, so ALPHV either wrote a Latin Language, or they are not Russian.
